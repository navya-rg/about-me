		<dt><b>Basketball</b></dt>
		<dd>I have been playing basketball for the past 6 years and it has been an integral part of my life. It started out with me trying out the sport for fun and then actually liking it. Basketball can be a great way to take my mind of the stress and not to mention participating in tournaments and meeting other teams. It can be a whole new experience every single time.</dd><br>
